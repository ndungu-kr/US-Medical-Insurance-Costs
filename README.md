# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs

In this project, I investigate US Medical Insurance costs provided in the **insurance.csv** file using Python. The goal of this project is to analyze various attributes within **insurance.csv** to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset **insurance.csv** contains information about medical insurance costs for individuals. It includes the following attributes:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual (male or female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (ratio of weight to height) of the individual.
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
- **Region**: Geographic region of the individual (northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest).
- **Charges**: Medical insurance costs for the individual.

## Project Structure

- **US-Medical-Insurance-Costs/**: Main project folder.
  - **insurance.csv**: The dataset file containing the insurance data.
  - **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for data analysis.
  - **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.
  - **requirements.txt**: File listing the required libraries for running the analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis and explore the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `analysis.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and attributes.
3. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, if any, and ensuring data consistency.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing various attributes to gain insights.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing findings and potential use cases for the dataset.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to gain a better understanding of medical insurance costs and the factors influencing them. By analyzing the dataset, we can uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that may be valuable for insurance companies, policymakers, and individuals alike.
